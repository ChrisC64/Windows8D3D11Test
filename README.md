=================

Going hands-on with Direct3D 11 Tools, I aim to learn about HLSL and how to utilize them with my program, and also teach myself the tools of Direct3D 11 and utilize it for making graphical applications and games. 


My steps are: 

1. Learn the differences between DX9 (last used DX tools I personally used)
2. Learn how to set up the contexts and devices
3. Display a 3D Object/model
4. Learn HLSL and how to apply them to an object and use for rendering techniques. 
5. Begin utilizing the given tools and steps and perform a simple game. (Pong, Tetris, or some other simple game with either 2D or 3D objects)
